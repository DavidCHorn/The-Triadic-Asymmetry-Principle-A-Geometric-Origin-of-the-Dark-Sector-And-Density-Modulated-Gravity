# The-Triadic-Asymmetry-Principle-A-Geometric-Origin-of-the-Dark-Sector-And-Density-Modulated-Gravity
The Triadic Asymmetry Principle (TAP) is a geometric framework in which Motion,  Time, and Space form an ordered non-commuting triad. The non-closure of the triad  is quantified by the asymmetry scalar  \\( A = \|[M, T, S]\| \\), which acts as a new geometric invariant.
