*The Triadic Asymmetry Principle: 
A Unified Geometric Origin of Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Density-Modulated Gravity.*

The Triadic Asymmetry Principle (TAP) is a geometric framework in which Motion, 
Time, and Space form an ordered non-commuting triad. The non-closure of the triad 
is quantified by the asymmetry scalar 
\\( A = \|[M, T, S]\| \\), which acts as a new geometric invariant.

A deformation of the gravitational action by \\( F(A) \\) generates three emergent 
late-time cosmological sectors:

1. A density-modulated effective Newton coupling \\( G_\mathrm{eff}(\rho) \\) 
2. A rigidity-dominated matter component (TRM) 
3. A geometric dark-energy sector proportional to the triadic asymmetry

The framework is fully covariant, introduces no new fields, recovers General 
Relativity in high-density regimes through geometric screening, and predicts 
correlated signatures related to the Hubble tension, the \\( S_8 \\) anomaly, 
and recent DESI indications of evolving \\( w(z) \\).
